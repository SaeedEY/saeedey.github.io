  "about_me": "This is the public version; for the most accurate and detailed CV, please connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nMy passion for AI—particularly in Computer Vision—drives my ambition to pursue a Master’s program and advance my current and future career. During my undergraduate studies, that motivation wasn’t initially well reflected. Nevertheless, this marked a turning point in my academic journey, inspiring a stronger commitment that resulted in excellent grades in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence & Expert Systems modules. Moreover, one of my lecturers, who was diagnosed with cancer during adolescence and successfully overcame it, inspired my aspiration to focus future academic research on medical or facial recognition purposes.\nMy professional career started as an IT Support Specialist and now continues as a DevOps Engineer. With nearly three years of experience, I’m thrilled to embark on my M.Sc. in AI and to leverage my professional and academic background effectively.",
