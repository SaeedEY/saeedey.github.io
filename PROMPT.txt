Generate a complete, modern, privacy-first, multilingual, static online academic CV with this exact architecture and behavior:

### Core Requirements
1. Project must be 100% static (HTML + CSS + vanilla JS only, no frameworks, no backend)
2. Must work perfectly on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages
3. Must be completely invisible to all search engines and AI crawlers

### Exact File Structure
.
├── index.html
├── 404.html
├── robots.txt
├── PROMPT.txt                 ← this prompt
├── README.md
├── generate-bin.py            ← Python script that encrypts all private templates
├── data/
│   ├── public.json            ← public redacted CV
│   ├── schema.json            ← full JSON schema with comments
│   ├── resume.bin             ← final encrypted binary (multiple AES-GCM payloads)
│   └── private/
│       ├── academic_de.json   ← full German version
│       ├── academic_uk.json   ← full UK English version
│       └── academic_ca.json   ← full Canadian English version
├── css/style.css              ← minified, <3 KB
├── js/main.js                 ← fully commented vanilla JS
└── .gitignore                 ← contains: data/private

### Privacy & Access System (exact behavior)
- Public version loads from data/public.json
- Private versions are encrypted inside data/resume.bin as multiple independent AES-GCM payloads
- generate-bin.py reads every JSON in data/private/, encrypts each with its own 36-char key (UUIDv4 or custom), appends all payloads into resume.bin
- Access via URL hash only: https://domain.com/#550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-426614174000
- main.js reads location.hash → normalizes to lowercase → tries to decrypt every payload in resume.bin using the hash as password
- First successful decryption wins → instantly renders full private CV (no page reload)
- If no valid key → show public version + subtle "Detailed version available upon request"
- Case-insensitive keys, always stored/normalized as lowercase

### 404.html Behavior
- Must detect any 36-character string (alphanumeric + -_) at the end of the path
- Regex: /([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{36})$/i
- Instantly redirect /any36charstring → /#any36charstring (lowercase) + preserve query string
- Clean centered "Redirecting..." message with noindex meta tags
- Must include meta blocks for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Googlebot, etc.

### Design & Typography (exact style)
- Ultra-compact single-column academic layout (no sidebar ever)
- Header: Name (Libre Baskerville, large), tagline, one-line contact bar
- Contact bar format: Location • email • LinkedIn • GitHub • ORCID • phone
  → all clickable, text-only, separated by •, ORCID in official green (#a6d189)
- Gradient top bar (purple → pink)
- Framed entries (education, experience, publications) with subtle border + hover lift
- One featured project as highlighted card
- Consistent bullet indentation across all sections (especially Certificates, Interests, Work Experience)
- Minimal footer: "17 Nov 2025 | Private" in tiny light gray
- Fonts: Inter (body) + Libre Baskerville (name)
- Fully responsive + print = perfect one-page A4 PDF (no shadows, no gradient in print)

### Technical Requirements
- All CSS delivered minified
- Full Web Crypto API usage (AES-GCM, subtle.crypto.importKey, etc.)
- Proper error handling (failed decryption → silent fallback to public)
- robots.txt must block everything (User-agent: * Disallow: / + specific AI bots)
- index.html must contain complete <meta> blockade:
  noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet, noimageindex
  + specific blocks for GPTBot, ClaudeBot, Googlebot, etc.
- UUID/key handling must be case-insensitive everywhere

### Output You Must Provide
1. index.html (complete with all meta tags)
2. css/style.css (fully minified, current ultra-compact version with ORCID styling)
3. js/main.js (fully commented, including blind decryption loop)
4. 404.html (with redirect + loading message)
5. generate-bin.py (working script using cryptography.hazmat, supports multiple files)
6. robots.txt (complete block)
7. .gitignore (containing data/private)
8. data/public.json (full working example with ORCID)
9. data/schema.json (complete commented schema)
10. One example private file (e.g. academic_uk.json)
11. Final README.md explaining the full system + how to replicate using this prompt

Make it beautiful, private, multilingual-ready, print-perfect, and ultra-professional — exactly like a top-tier AI researcher’s personal site in 2025.
